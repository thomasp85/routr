    desc: >
      While the R6 classes that are the foundation of routr allow you to
      manipulate and work with them directly through their class methods, it is
      often more convenient to use a functional and pipe-friendly interface.

    desc: >
      A router based on routr is build up of Route objects combined together
      into a RouteStack object. Requests are passed through each route in a
      RouteStack and subjected to whatever handlers get matched to the URL at
      each step.

      A few predetermined route functionalities have constructors that help you
      create them easily.
